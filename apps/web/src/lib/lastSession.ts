/**
 * A record of who was last signed in on this device.
 *
 * Written when auth confirms a session and cleared on sign-out, so that a boot
 * which cannot reach the server still knows whose local data to open. Kept as
 * our own key rather than read out of Supabase's session blob: the shape of
 * that blob is a library implementation detail, and this only needs an id.
 *
 * It is not a credential and grants nothing on its own. Every server request
 * still carries the real token, and sign-out clears both this and the local
 * database (wipeLocalData), so it cannot expose one account's data to the next
 * person on a shared device.
